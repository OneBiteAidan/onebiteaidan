### A bit about me!
- I'm a third year Computer Engineering student
- At University I research autonomous underwater robotics
- In my free time I focus on personal projects, my largest of which is my Minecraft server TownyTTV
- I've been practicing Java for 5 years and am fluent in the Spigot API 
- Aside from development, I love media analysis and learning about game design

### Some goals for 2023:
- Become more familiar with GitHub actions and CI/CD processes
- Begin actively networking with other developers

- Build my own website
